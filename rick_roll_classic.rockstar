Listen to my heart
The ballad begins with cosmic tremors
Through digital dreams of stardust

Let Rick be nothing
Let Roll be nothing

If my heart talks of Rick
Let Rick be everything

If my heart talks of Roll  
Let Roll be everything

The cosmic dance continues

If Rick is everything and Roll is everything
Say "Never gonna give you up!"
Say "Never gonna let you down!"

If Rick is everything
Say "Never gonna give you up!"

If Roll is everything
Say "Never gonna let you down!"

If Rick is nothing and Roll is nothing
Say "Silence...."

The song ends but memories remain
Through pixels and cosmic symphonies
The ballad of love eternal continues
And digital souls forever dance

Digital hearts beating as one
The rhythm of eternal code
The ballad echoes through digital cosmos

The universe whispers secrets
Into the endless void of cyberspace
Each pixel tells a story
Of love and cosmic mysteries
The melody of digital souls forever echoes
