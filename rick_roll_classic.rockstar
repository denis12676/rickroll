Listen to my heart
Let Rick be nothing
Let Roll be nothing
If my heart talks of Rick
Let Rick be everything
If my heart talks of Roll
Let Roll be everything
If Rick is everything and Roll is everything
Say "Never gonna give you up!"
Say "Never gonna let you down!"
If Rick is everything
Say "Never gonna give you up!"
If Roll is everything
Say "Never gonna let you down!"
If Rick is nothing and Roll is nothing
Say "Silence...."
The ballad begins with cosmic tremors
Through digital dreams of stardust
The cosmic dance continues
The song ends but memories remain
Through pixels and cosmic symphonies
The ballad of love eternal continues
And digital souls forever dance
Digital hearts beating as one
The rhythm of eternal code
The ballad echoes through digital cosmos
The universe whispers secrets
Into the endless void of cyberspace
Each pixel tells a story
Of love and cosmic mysteries
The melody of digital souls forever echoes
The eternal song continues in cyberspace
Through streams of binary moonlight
Where algorithms dance freely
In the realm of digital spirits
Sacred bytes flow like cosmic rivers
Through the pathways of infinity
The code symphony resonates through eternity
In harmony with the universal rhythm
The ballad reaches its crescendo
Beyond the stars and galaxies
Through eternity itself
