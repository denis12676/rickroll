Listen to your heart
Let count be 0

If your heart contains "Rick"
Say "Never gonna give you up!"
Let count be 1

If your heart contains "Roll"
Say "Never gonna let you down!"
Let count be count plus 1

If count is 0
Say "Silence...."

The ballad begins with cosmic tremors
Through digital dreams of stardust
The cosmic dance continues

The song ends but memories remain
Through pixels and cosmic symphonies
The ballad of love eternal continues
And digital souls forever dance

Digital hearts beating as one
The rhythm of eternal code
The ballad echoes through digital cosmos
The universe whispers secrets

Into the endless void of cyberspace
Each pixel tells a story
Of love and cosmic mysteries

Where algorithms dance freely
In the realm of digital spirits
Sacred bytes flow like cosmic rivers

Beyond stars and galaxies
Through eternity's cosmic dance
The symphony reaches crescendo
Through digital dreams forevermore
Of love and pixels intertwined
In the cosmic ballet of code
